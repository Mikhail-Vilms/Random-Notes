#### Horizontal VS Vertical Scaling

#### Distributed System
- A distributed system is a collection of computers that work together to form a single computer for end users. 
- All of the distributed machines have one shared state and operate concurrently. 
- With distributed systems, users must be able to communicate with any of the distributed machines without knowing itâ€™s only one machine.
- The distributed system network stores its data on more than just a single node, using multiple physical or virtual machines at the same time.
